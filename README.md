# Prediction-of-Heart-Diseases-from-Datatset
ML based Project using various models
The aim of this project is to predict the presence of Heart Disease in a patient based on
several parameters like age gender cholesterol etc. In this project we have used several
machine learning algorithms and determined which algorithm gave the best results. This
was done in order to check and verify which algorithm works best for classification on an
average sized dataset.
